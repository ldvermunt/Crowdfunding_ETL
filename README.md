# Crowdfunding_ETL
ETL Module
## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to familiarize myself with the ETL process.
## Overview
The data used was a number of csv's from a fictional crowdfunding company.
These csv's were "Extrated" from their source files, "Transformed" using Pandas in Jupyter Notebook and then "Loaded" into SQL where I was able to further analyze the data and merge csv's to return data applicable to the company.  Using a number of tools and incorporating their uses within each other was valuable information which helped to create more understanding of the data analysis process.
